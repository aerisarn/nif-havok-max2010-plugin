    Requirements
    ------------

      Plugins:
        3D Studio Max 2012, 2015, 2016

    Installation
    ------------
    
    Installer:
        The installer will configure the plugins for whichever releases
        you have available on your machine.  It will also optionally configure
        texture paths for various games that we know there settings for.
    
    Copy NifPlugins.dlu, to your 3dsmax\plugins directory.

	Copy MaxNifTools.ini to the correct plugcfg directory:
      For 2013 and later:
        %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Autodesk\3dsMax\<version>\enu\en-US\plugcfg
        
      For 2012 and less:
        Windows Vista and Greater:
          %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Autodesk\3dsMax\<version>\enu\plugcfg
        Windows XP:
          %APPDATA%\Autodesk\3dsMax\<version>\enu\plugcfg
          
	You can copy MaxNifTools.ini to your 3dsmax\plugcfg directory but the
	  folder may be readonly so is discouraged but might still work.
      
    The plugin will search the AppData folder first though as that is the 
	  recommended location from Autodesk and Microsoft.

    
    gmax notes:
       NifPlugins.dlu goes in gmax\plugin folder
       MaxNifTools.ini goes in gmax\plugCFG folder
       winmm.dll goes in gmax folder where gmax.exe is located.
         Do not place it in the windows system folder.
        
    Usage
    -----
    
      Collision:
        
        Add bhkRigidBody from Create | Helpers | Niftools to represent
          a rigid body in havok.
          
        Add bhkCollProxy or bhkRigidBody Modifier to represent shapes
          and then link them to the bhkRigidBody.
          
      Exporter:
        Export files using "File | Export | Netimmerse/Gamebryo (*.NIF, *.KF)".

      Importer:
        Import files using "File | Import | Netimmerse/Gamebryo (*.NIF, *.KF)"
  
      Settings:
        Its recommended that you edit the MaxNifTools.ini file to adjust 
        paths and other settings to your machine to make it easier to work with.
    
        1. Remove irrelevant applications from the KnownApplications list
        2. Fix the RootPaths, TexturePaths and TextureSearchPaths in the 
            Applications for your machine.
        

    Additional Notes
    ----------------

    If your collision mesh comes out deformed, go to the utilities tab, 
    choose "Reset XForm" and click "Reset Selected". This should fix it.
