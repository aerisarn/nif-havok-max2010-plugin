# nif-havok-max2010-plugin
This is a modified version of figment's NIF plugin version which relies on havok tools for handling creature collisions and ragdoll

I did not fork directly due the amount of unclean code present in this version, mostly the result of my learning NIF file format and Havok tools. I fully plan to do a more structured patch/pull request on the latest plugin version after a lot of cleaning, in the meanwhile I saved the code here.
